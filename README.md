# Gemini and LangChain-Based RAG Chatbot Development

This project aims to develop a chatbot using Google's Gemini language model and the LangChain library, implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a technique that enhances the accuracy and relevance of responses by retrieving external information instead of relying solely on pre-trained data.
